  bio: `Data scientist and developer by day, roblox Connoisseur by day as well. ITAM graduate with a consistent track record: my code never works on the first try 🥀 but occasionally works on the second.

I deploy Lambdas and containers in ECS straight to prod without testing because I like to live. They work. Sometimes. Usually not on the first try. 🥀`,
